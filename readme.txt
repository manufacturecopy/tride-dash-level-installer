tride dash level installer
tride was too lazy to make servers and the way levels are saved is confusing, so why not just send a zip to your friends instead? 

tride dash level ripper soon probably idk

how to use:

put your own level and music files in "saves" and "music" respectively, zip this up, and send it to a friend. everything else should work as intended.

this took me like an hour to make so it's probably not very good but uh it works kinda

and then when you are done, zip everything in this directory and send it to your friends i guess
